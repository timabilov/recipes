# Recipe Normalizer

## Objective

Develop a command-line application that normalizes cooking recipes from various
input formats (like XML, YAML, among few others) to a consistent JSON file format.

The application should read all recipes in a given directory.

The application must convert imperial units to metric units (like pound -> grams, fl. oz. -> ml, etc...)

The output is a single JSON file with all the parsed recipes.

## Time limit
Approx. 2 hours

## What should you submit?
* Your code in Python
* Unit Tests
* Bonus- Dockerfile (if time allows it, ship a Dockerfile with your solution to run your app)


## Notes
* Pay attention to architecture.
* It is fine to make reasonable assumptions, just document them.
* You are provided with example input and output files.
* You can use external packages if needed, for trivial use cases.


Good Luck!
